                   Plans to achieve "game of the year" title especially with a game that I am proud of. Have done some beta testing for some games like 
                   Honkai Impact 3rd.

                    <h1 class="faq">Have I made a game?</h1>
                    <p id="ans">I have a concept in mind as that is the main thing I like to do, I have at least 3 game concepts in mind all different genres.
                        When I have the time I would love to try and main these concepts into the real thing.

                    <h1 class="faq">What was my inspiration to pursue this?</h1>
                    <p id="ans">When I was young, I was never really a fan of computers as I never really got to use one, till I played a game called
                        Persona 3 Portable, it made me interestedin how games are made and it was also the game that made me interested in UI design.

                    <p id="ans">No, The course I wanted to take was marine biology as I am facinated by sea creatures, though the first game I do
                        want to make is a water related game as I have been greatly inspired by Subnautica and Raft.
